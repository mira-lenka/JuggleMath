# Welcome to the JuggleMath Application

JuggleMath is a calculator for Combinatorics, Number Theory, Numerical System conversions and matrices. It is aimed at students of scientific and technical studies who want to check their answers against a calculator and teachers who seek help in
preparing classes for their students. The application is currently only available in Polish.

## Technologies used

JuggleMath was developed in Java SpringBoot with JavaScript React frontend.

## How to use

Requirements: Java and Next.js installed on the computer
